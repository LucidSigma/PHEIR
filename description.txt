Pre-hardmode–Exclusive Item Recipes (PHEIR) is tiny mod that adds recipes for items that become unavailable in hardmode.

The mod adds the following recipes:
• Hel-Fire —> Cascade (shimmer transmutation).
• Orange Zapinator —> Grey Zapinator (shimmer transmutation).

If there are any pre-hardmode–Exclusive items in major content mods, let me know and I'll add recipes for them.
